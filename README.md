# Sorting-Algorithms-in-Python

## In this repository I will explain some of the popular sorting algorithms.

1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quicksort

Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that compares two adjacent elements and swaps them until they are in the intended order.

Just like the movement of air bubbles in the water that rise up to the surface, each element of the array move to the end in each iteration. Therefore, it is called a bubble sort.

Working of Bubble Sort
Suppose we are trying to sort the elements in ascending order.

# (Compare and Swap)

1. Starting from the first index, compare the first and the second elements.
2. If the first element is greater than the second element, they are swapped.
3. Now, compare the second and the third elements. Swap them if they are not in order.
4. The above process goes on until the last element
